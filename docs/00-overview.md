# SOC L1 Security Lab — Overview

This project simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 environment focused on defensive cybersecurity.

The lab replicates a small enterprise network including:
- Firewall and routing (pfSense)

- Centralized logging and alert analysis

The main objective is to practice detection, triage, and response to security incidents in a controlled environment.
